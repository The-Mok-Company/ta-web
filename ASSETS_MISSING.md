# Missing Assets - Action Required

The following CSS and JavaScript files are missing and need to be copied from your server:

## Required Files:
- `public/assets/css/vendors.css`
- `public/assets/css/aiz-core.css`
- `public/assets/css/custom-style.css`
- `public/assets/css/bootstrap-rtl.min.css` (if using RTL)
- `public/assets/js/vendors.js`
- `public/assets/js/aiz-core.js`

## How to Fix:

1. **From Server (Recommended):**
   - Connect to your server via FTP/SFTP
   - Copy the entire `public/assets` folder from the server
   - Paste it into your local `public/` directory

2. **Alternative:**
   - If you have access to the original project files, copy the assets folder
   - Or download from the project source/backup

## Temporary Solution:
Placeholder files have been created to prevent 404 errors, but the UI will not work properly until the actual assets are restored.
